Fast track compilation for Ubuntu.
----------------------------------

I get a segfault when building with gcc-6. A successful build with gcc-4.9 and the instructions below show how to select that compiler.

$ sudo apt-get install tk-dev tcl-dev build-essential libc6-dev g++-multilib zlib1g-dev:i386 libgmp-dev:i386
$ git clone git://github.com/mozart/mozart
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 ../mozart/configure --disable-contrib-gdbm --prefix=/tmp/oz
$ make && make install
$ export OZHOME=/tmp/oz
$ export PATH=$PATH:$OZHOME/bin

Change the prefix path and `OZHOME` to where you want it installed. Run `oz` to start the IDE.

Installation.
-------------
